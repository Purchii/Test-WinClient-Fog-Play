# Scripts

Implemented local runners:

```text
quality-gate.ps1
run-app-webview-smoke.ps1
run-backend-smoke.ps1
run-game-session-canary.ps1
run-nonprod-foundation.ps1
run-privacy-gate.ps1
run-prod-canary.ps1
run-prod-safe-smoke.ps1
run-release-gate.ps1
run-testability-gaps.ps1
run-update-manifest-gate.ps1
run-webview-bridge-contract.ps1
```

These runners are guard/dry-run first. They must not launch the Windows client, enable WebView debug/CDP, authenticate, start a game session, call production backend or streaming services, mutate production state, read user AppData/logs/cookies/DB/dumps, enable CI/CD, or change dependencies by default.

Use `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ...` on machines where local script execution is restricted by PowerShell policy.

The `Context` quality gate fails if this inventory stops listing any `scripts/*.ps1` runner.

The `RunnerSafety` quality gate fails if a `run-*.ps1` runner loses `-DryRun`, stops rejecting missing `-DryRun`, exposes an unguarded dangerous `Allow*` switch, or introduces forbidden runtime/network primitives.
