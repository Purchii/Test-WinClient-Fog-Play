# Current state

Project: MTC Fog Play Windows client QA automation.

Known context:

- Windows desktop client.
- Native layer: C++.
- Embedded WebView/CEF/WebView-like layer.
- Product: cloud gaming.
- Current automation may run against production.
- Production safety is the first priority.

Current milestone state:

```text
M0: ProdSafety + Git/Handoff/Verification governance foundation - implemented and merged to main.
M1: Release artifact + privacy/logging gates - implemented on codex/release-privacy-gates, with M1.1 hardening in progress.
M2: App launch + WebView smoke - planned only, not implemented.
```

Do not start real game-session automation before the guard layer is hardened and a separate NON_AUTONOMOUS game-session canary plan is approved.

Repository bootstrap state:

- This is a new project repository.
- The remote repository was empty during M0 bootstrap.
- Starter governance docs were imported as the initial `main` baseline.
- M0 implementation was completed on `codex/prod-safety-foundation` and merged to `main`.
- M1 implementation is on `codex/release-privacy-gates`.
- Current installed artifact source for offline checks: `C:\Program Files\MTC Fog Play`.
- Windows client source, WebView/CEF/WebView2 frontend, native bridge handlers, updater/package scripts, existing tests/CI and telemetry/crash code are not present yet.

Current artifact status:

- Release/privacy gate implementation exists.
- The installed artifact is not release-clean by current policy: unsigned `rds-client.exe`/`Uninstall.exe`/`crashpad_handler.exe`, sourcemaps, source map references and a local path in `installer_info.txt` were reported.
